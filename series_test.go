As they grew into their teens, they suddenly noticed that one of them was a girl, and Kazuya and Minami became closer. Kazuya, the younger twin, was an excellent student (as was Minami).</Overview>

<Overview>In 1980s Britain, with disaffected punks and skinheads taking to the streets, and the repercussions of racism triggering explosive riots, it is not the best time to be a member of Her Majesty's Constabulary - particularly if you are a woman. Set on location in colourful Soho and Covent Garden, The Gentle Touch tells the story of tough cop Maggie Forbes. But this is no conventional cops and robbers series - this is real life drama. At times shocking, at times moving, and always utterly gripping</Overview>

<banner>graphical/248935-g2.jpg</banner>
<Overview>"Touch" is a preternatural drama where science and spirituality meet in which we are all interconnected. The show follows a group of unrelated characters. One of these is Martin Bohm (Kiefer Sutherland), a widower and a single father who is haunted by an inability to connect to his mute and severely autistic 10-year-old son, Jake. Martin has tried everything he could do in order to reach his son, but at no success. To spend his time, Jake has cast-off cell phones, disassembling them and manipulating the parts. This allows him to see the world in a different way entirely. Martin is visited by social worker Clea Hopkins. She insists on doing an evaluation of the living situation.

Clea sees Martin as a man whose life has become dominated by a child he can no longer control.</Overview>
